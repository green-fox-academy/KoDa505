          How She Got There

          An interview with Mule Design’s Erika Hall about
          philosophy, phone calls and her professional journey.

          <em>
            In the fall
            of 2013 I interviewed Erika  Hall, co-founder of <a href="http://muledesign.com"> Mule Design Studio</a>, one of
            the most influential design  practices in North America. It was the first of
            fourteen interviews that I would conduct for my book How They Got There:
            Interviews With Digital Designers About Their Careers, and so in many ways
            it was the most important, too.
          </em>

          <strong>
            You studied philosophy at
            Dartmouth. How did you get from there into doing the kind of work that
            you’re doing? .
          </strong>

        <p>
          What was the first step?Well, let’s see, the first
          step was graduating into a recession with a philosophy degree [laughs]
